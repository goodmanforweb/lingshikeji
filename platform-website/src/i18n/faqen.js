Each game is a closed and centralized economic system that can be artificially modified, so that the income of a game cannot be transferred to and connected to another game economy. system. But after the blockchain was created, the Crypto Joy team was inspired to think that the blockchain security, trustworthiness, distributed accounting, and non-temperable features just happen to achieve the deficiencies in classical games, thus making players and developers Benefits can be achieved.`
